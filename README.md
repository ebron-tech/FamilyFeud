## ⚠️Still under development ⚠️

If you are a normal user please read the [user documentation]() that covers the basics about how to use the Board, the controller board, and add your own questions and responses to the game.

Assuming you are a developer, have some coding knowledge or just a Unity3d fan. The project was made with:
1. Unity 2019.1.8f1.
    1. Shader Graph (5.7.2) (download from Unity package manager).
    2. Lightweight RP (5.7.2) (download from Unity package manager).
    3. OSC communication protocol [git package](https://github.com/keijiro/OscJack).

The binaries contain 3 elements:
1. The app ( the build compiled for Windows and OSX).
2. The controller app ( another app that is used to control the main board).
3. The rounds folder ( next to the apps): inside this folder are stored all the rounds in .json format.
